Kamloops.js talks proposals
---------------------------

We are more than welcoming of people who want to do a talk on any
javascript related topic (even loosly related). Once you have a talk in mind
just issue a pull request adding a new file to the `talks` directory. It should
look like this:

`jonotron-my-awesome-talk.md` 
(github username or twitter handle, talk title)

And should have the format:

My Awesome Talk Title
=====================

By: [Jonathan Bowers](http://twitter.com/thejonotron)

Here is a short one-line description of my talk.

Here is an expanded version of my talk with details about what will be 
covered, etc. It should describe what the attendees should expect to
learn from your talk.

* It can also contain lists
* or not

### Other bits

If you have any other things you want to include, like images or files, 
just include a directory with the same name as your talk and stick them
in there.
